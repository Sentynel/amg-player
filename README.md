Angry Metal Guy Player (amg) is a Python command line tool to automatically play tracks from [Angry Metal Guy](http://www.angrymetalguy.com/) reviews.

I created this because:  

* I like Angry Metal Guy, and discovered great music (both metal and totally non-metal) thanks to their reviews
* I often disagree with their ratings (in fact I disagree more often than I agree), both for overrating and underrating
* Even when I disagree, I like reading their reviews
* I want to listen to the music **before** I read the review, to avoid getting influenced
* To be efficient, I want to listen to the tracks like a radio, and read the review to learn more only when I like something


**This is a work in progress** (ie. probably not usable for you right now).
